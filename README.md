# Universal Card Fix (UCF)

UCF is a community-made patch with the primary purpose of creating a more
compelling and dynamic end-state for high-level Slay the Spire while being as faithful to the base game as possible.
Examples of problems we are trying to address include: early game snowballs, over centralized strategies, excessive
healing which eliminates the need for accurate play, and events which have little to no player agency. Included in the
patch are also a handful of minor buffs to cards which have fallen out of the meta-game (except for extremely rare niche
cases), in the hope that they become viable outs more often.

UCF is -not- interested in making the game harder for the sake of being hard, and thus pushing win-rates down
artificially. Nonetheless, we expect this patch to be more difficult than the base game, if only because it reduces the
number of free wins that players come across as a result of snowball starts becoming less common.
